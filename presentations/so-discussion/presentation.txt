Research Questions

to do update after fixing storyline
1. How prevalent are question chatted on Stack Overflow?

3. How does chatting affect question answering activities?

RQ1: Do discussions helps with answering questions on
Stack Overflow?

I Discussion is prevalent in all phases of answering activities (from
before answer to after accepted answer)
I Discussion is used by answerers for answering activities (Answerer’s
appearance in discussion)
I Questions with small amount of discussions receives answers
(accepted answers) faster.
Discussions are prevalent on Stack Overflow and they are an
essential part of the answering process

RQ1R1: When do discussion happen relative to answering
activities?

Discussion in comments exist in all phases of question answering activities
on Stack Overflow. For answered (solved) questions, when discussions
exist, they start before the answer (accepted answer).

question answering.

Most discussions start before questions receive answers. About half of
discussions ends before receiving answers while others continue after the
question receives answers. Even after a question receives the accepted
answer, discussion could happen.

RQ1R2: continued. . .

This observation suggests that users posting answers also
participate in discussions. Users also participate in discussions after
they post answers, even the later accepted answers. It supports our
conjecture that discussions facilitate the answering process and is essential
to question answering activities.
In QuestionWithChat a higher percentage of questions are answered
(both any answer and the accepted answer) by users participating
in chat. The higher percentage compared to comments suggests that
users are more involved with the question when they participate in chat.
They show a stronger will to help the asker and provide answers especially
accepted answers.

RQ1R3: Do discussions speed up question answering?

Figure 1: Distribution of time to first answer by number of comments before first
answer

Continued. . .

Questions with a small amount of discussion receive answers faster
than questions with no discussion. When discussions for questions
exist, the time to receive answers increases as the amount of discussion
increases. When questions have less than 8 comments, they receive
answers faster than questions with no comments. This finding could imply
that small amounts of discussion is beneficial to questions and decreases
the amount of time for receiving answers.

Continued. . .
The same trend exists for accepted answers. However, when the discussion
reaches 5 comments, questions with discussions require longer time to
receive their accepted answer.-

For QuestionWithChat

Questions with chat rooms takes much longer to answer compared to most
questions.
First answer: median 5493.5 secs
Accepted answer: median 7892 secs

RQ2: How do users leverage the commenting and chatting
communication channels?

I While discussion is prevalent, most discussion for Stack Overflow
questions is done through commenting.
I Despite the option to chat is available to many users, only few
created the chat room.
I Most users move the discussion completely into chat rooms after its
creation, few comment and chat at the same time.

RQ2R1: How much discussion happen in the two
communication channels?

Commenting is the dominating communication channel with 33.5 million
comments associated with 9,900,628 questions on Stack Overflow.
While only 19,527 questions have chat rooms, these chat rooms generate
more than 1 million messages.

RQ2R2: Do users opt to use the chat room when its
available?

Despite 408,248 questions have triggered the option to create a chat room,
in 91.3% (i.e., 372,532) of the questions, a chat room was not created.

RQ2R3: Where do users discuss when both
communication channels are available?

Discussions in 68.5% (i.e., 13,372) of QuestionWithChat move completely
into the chat room after its creation.
When both communication channels are available, in 17.4% (i.e., 3,401) of
QuestionWithChat users make use of both communication channels at the
same time. ← WZ: this number is upper bound, could be affected by the
switching pain.

RQ3: How do chatting and commenting differ?

Incomplete
I Chatting provides a more interactive communication channel
compared to commenting (commenting takes a factor of 5.2 longer
than chatting to receive replies)
I WZ: to explore: ave char length → push for communication style
difference
I WZ: to explore: sentiment → push for a less strict chatting
environment

Highlights

I Discussions are essential in the answering process, answerers use it as
a means to communicate with the asker through discussions.
I Of the two available methods, users use comments mone than chat.
While chat is available, most users stick with chat.
I Chat offers a more interactive channel compared to comments.

Extra RQ: How well does the chat room mechanism work
on Stack Overflow?

I Do users accept the offer when triggered the option to create a chat
room?
I How many chat rooms end up worth retaining?
I Can we find the sweet spot for offering the option to create a chat
room so chat rooms won’t be deleted?
WZ: I think this RQ suits better for the chat room empirical paper
